    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) makes it easy to build the workflows required for human review of ML predictions. Amazon A2I brings human review to all developers, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building human review systems or managing large numbers of human reviewers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can create your own workflows for ML models built on Amazon SageMaker or any other tools. Using Amazon A2I, you can allow human reviewers to step in when a model is unable to make a high confidence prediction or to audit its predictions on an on-going basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more here: https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how you can use **Amazon A2I with an Amazon SageMaker Hosted Endpoint.** We will be using an exisiting object detection endpoint in this notebook. We will also demonstrate how to manipulate the A2I output to perform incremental training to improve the model accuracy with the newly labeled data using A2I.\n",

    "To incorporate Amazon A2I into your human review workflows, you need three resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **worker task template** to create a worker UI. The worker UI displays your input data, such as documents or images, and instructions to workers. It also provides interactive tools that the worker uses to complete your tasks. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-instructions-overview.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human review workflow**, also referred to as a flow definition. You use the flow definition to configure your human workforce and provide information about how to accomplish the human review task. You can create a flow definition in the Amazon Augmented AI console or with Amazon A2I APIs. To learn more about both of these options, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-create-flow-definition.html\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **human loop** to start your human review workflow. When you use one of the built-in task types, the corresponding AWS service creates and starts a human loop on your behalf when the conditions specified in your flow definition are met or for each object if no conditions were specified. When a human loop is triggered, human review tasks are sent to the workers as specified in the flow definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a custom task type, as this tutorial will show, you start a human loop using the Amazon Augmented AI Runtime API. When you call `start_human_loop()` in your custom application, a task is sent to human reviewers."

Next step in a typical machine learning life cycle is to include these cases with which the model has trouble in the next batch of training data for retraining purposes so that the model can now learn from a set of new training data to improve the model. In machine learning we call it [incremental training](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/incremental-training.html).\n",

If you want to create a custom RecordIO data, you could follow the steps outlined [here](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/build/examples_datasets/detection_custom.html). Alternatively, SageMaker built-in object detection algorithm also takes JSON file as annotation along with your JPEG/PNG images. You could create one JSON file per image as in **Train with the Image Format** in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection.html#object-detection-inputoutput), or take an advantage of [pipe mode](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/accelerate-model-training-using-faster-pipe-mode-on-amazon-sagemaker/) enabled by using [Augmented Manifest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/augmented-manifest.html) as input format. Pipe mode accelerate overall model training time up to 35% by streaming the data into the training algorithm while it is running instead of copying data to the EBS volume attached to the training instance.

    "After training, you would get a new model in the `s3_output_location`, you can deploy it to a new endpoint or modify an endpoint without taking models that are already deployed into production out of service. For example, you can add new model variants, update the ML Compute instance configurations of existing model variants, or change the distribution of traffic among model variants. To modify an endpoint, you provide a new endpoint configuration. Amazon SageMaker implements the changes without any downtime. For more information, see [UpdateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpoint.html) and [UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities.html).
