    "# Deriving inference insights for your ML models and sending low confidence predictions to human review workflows using Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor and Amazon A2I\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers. Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer. Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem. In this notebook we present the example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls. We show you how to setup a machine learning workflow on Amazon SageMaker to train a XGBoost Decision Trees algorithm for binary logistic predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will then deploy the model with a real-time endpoint, capture a configurable fraction of the data sent to the endpoint using the SageMaker SDK, create a baseline from the training dataset, launch a monitoring schedule, to let SageMaker Model Monitor inspect collected data and prediction quality, review the generated constraints and statistics, and trigger a human review loop for low confidence predictions. We will then show you how the human loop workers review/update the predictions which generates an annotations dataset. These annotations can be used to update your original training dataset for model re-training.\n",

The XGBoost algorithm performs well in machine learning competitions because of its robust handling of a variety of data types, relationships, distributions, and the variety of hyperparameters that you can fine-tune. You can use XGBoost for regression, classification (binary and multiclass), and ranking problems.\n",

If we re-run the inference for all requests in the test dataset we will see that the distributions are aligned in the 0 to 30% range and > 60% range. And since requests in this range will not trigger a model drift violation, these results are as expected for the model.

    "This notebook demonstrated how you can use Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor and Amazon A2I to setup a monitoring schedule for your Amazon SageMaker model endpoints, specify baselines that include constraint thresholds, observe inference traffic, derive insights such as model drift, completeness, data type violations and send the low confidence predictions to a Human Workflow with labelers to review and update the results. The human labeled output can be used to augment the training dataset for re-training and improving model accuracy."
