    "Developing a custom model to analyze images is a significant undertaking that requires time, expertise, and resources. It often takes months to complete. Additionally, it can require thousands or tens of thousands of hand-labeled images to provide the model with enough data to accurately make decisions. Generating this data can take months to gather, and can require large teams of labelers to prepare it for use in machine learning. In addition setting up a workflow for auditing or reviewing model predictions to validate adherence to your requirements can further add to the overall complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can identify the objects and scenes in images that are specific to your business needs. For example, you can find your logo in social media posts, identify your products on store shelves, classify machine parts in an assembly line, distinguish healthy and infected plants, or detect animated characters in videos. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels builds off of Amazon Rekognitionâ€™s existing capabilities, which are already trained on tens of millions of images across many categories. Instead of thousands of images, you can upload a small set of training images (typically a few hundred images or less) that are specific to your use case. Predictions from Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels can be easily sent to Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I). Amazon A2I makes it easy to integrate a human review into your machine learning workflow. This allows you to automatically have humans step into your ML pipeline to review results below a confidence threshold, for setting up review/auditing workflows and to augment the prediction results to improve model accuracy. \n",

    "In this post we show you to how to build a custom object detection model trained to detect pepperoni slices in a pizza using Amazon Rekognition custom labels with a dataset labeled using Amazon SageMaker GroundTruth. We then show how to create your own private workforce and setup an Amazon A2I workflow definition to conditionally trigger human loops for review and augmenting tasks. You can use the annotations created by Amazon A2I for model re-training. "

The Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console is where you create and manage your models. The first time you use the console, Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels asks to create an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. The bucket is used to store your Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels projects, datasets, and models.

    "This notebook demonstrated how you can use Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels and Amazon A2I to train models to detect objects and scenes unique to your business and define conditions to send the predictions to a Human Workflow with labelers to review and update the results. The human labeled output can be used to augment the training dataset for re-training, improving model accuracy or it can be sent to downstream applications for analytics and insights."
