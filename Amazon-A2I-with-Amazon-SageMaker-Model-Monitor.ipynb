    "# Deriving inference insights for your ML models and sending low confidence predictions to human review workflows using Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor and Amazon A2I\n",
    "\n",
    "When a ML model is deployed in production, monitoring the model is important for maintaining the quality of predictions. While the statistical properties of the training data are known in advance, incoming, real-life data can gradually deviate over time and negatively impact predictive power of your model, a phenomenon known as data drift. Detecting these conditions in production can be challenging and time-consuming, requiring a system that captures incoming real-time data, performs statistical analyses, defines rules to detect drift, and sends alerts for rule violations. Furthermore, the process must be repeated for every new iteration of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor enables you to efficiently and continuously monitor machine learning models in production. You can set alerts to detect deviations in the model quality and proactively take corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing data quality issues. You can use insights from Amazon Model Monitor to choose ML inferences to send to humans for review using Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I). Amazon A2I makes it easy to integrate a human review into your machine learning workflow. This allows you to automatically have humans step in and review data when a model is unable to make a high confidence prediction or to audit model predictions on an on-going basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we show how to setup a ML workflow on Amazon SageMaker to train a XGBoost algorithm for Breast Cancer prediction. We will then deploy the model with a real-time endpoint, capture a fraction of the data sent to the endpoint, create a baseline from the training dataset, launch a model monitoring schedule, review baseline constraints and statistics, and trigger a human review loop for below threshold predictions. We will then show how the human loop workers review/update the predictions that can be used to update your original training dataset for model re-training.\n",

Gradient boosting is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler and weaker models. The XGBoost algorithm performs well in machine learning competitions because of its robust handling of a variety of data types, relationships, distributions, and the variety of hyperparameters that you can fine-tune. You can use XGBoost for regression, classification (binary and multiclass), and ranking problems.\n",

If you don’t need the features and flexibility of open source XGBoost, consider using the built-in version.

Further, we recommend that you have enough total memory in selected instances to hold the training data.

The human labeled output can be used to augment the training dataset for re-training, keeping the distribution variance within threshold, preventing data drift and improving model accuracy."
